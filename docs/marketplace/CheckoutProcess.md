At this point, we must login to the system, if we have not yet logged in. In this case, we are not logged in, so we will create a new account to login. There is the option to login using facebook or twitter, but for this demonstration, we will log in using Email.

The new email used for the account must be verified by email, and there should be an email from the platform to verify the mail like this.
