# At this point, we must login to the system, if we have not yet logged in. In this case, we are not logged in, so we will create a new account to login. There is the option to login using facebook or twitter, but for this demonstration, we will log in using Email.

# The new email used for the account must be verified by email, and there should be an email from the platform to verify the mail like this.

# With that, now we have the option of selecting how we wish to get the product. One option is selecting a pickup point, which is already defined by the website admin, or we can choose Home Delivery. In this case, we will select "Home Delivery"
